# Projects
This repository will house all of my projects that I am working on


Projects that I am working on:

- Book Club Application: Creating a book club application that will allow people to meet virtual or in person

- Transit Ticketing Application: https://github.com/gia534/2021AppDevelopmentProject

- Trivia Minute android application: Followed a tutorial to create a quiz application using SQLite. The project now allows users to choose between 4 different difficulty levels. The application will be published shortly after all questions are created. Will continue to grow on the application that will allow users to create their own quizzes.
