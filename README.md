This repository will house all of my projects that I am working on

Android Application projects:

The application will be published shortly after all questions are created. Will continue to grow on the application that will allow users to create their own quizzes. Latest update as of August 10, 2021. Application is completed and will be on Google play shortly. As mentioned before, future updates will allow users to create their own quizzes.
